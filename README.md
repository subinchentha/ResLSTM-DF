## Project Structure
- `preprocessing/preprocess-celebDF.ipynb`: Data preprocessing script
- `training/train_resnet_lstm.ipynb`: Model training and evaluation script

## Prerequisites
- Google Colab with GPU (T4 recommended)
- Google Drive access
- Python 3.8+
- 16GB+ RAM recommended

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subinchenha/ResLSTM-DF.git
   cd ResLSTM-DF
   ```

2. **Set Up Google Colab**:
   - Upload the notebook files to Google Colab.
   - Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset:
     ```python
     from google.colab import drive
     drive.mount('/content/drive')
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following in a Colab cell:
   ```bash
   !pip install opencv-python numpy pandas torch torchvision tqdm sklearn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Download the Celeb-DF dataset (see [Dataset](#dataset) section).
   - Place it in `/content/drive/MyDrive/Celeb-DF`.
   - Run the preprocessing script (`preprocess-celebDF.ipynb`) to generate face clips and metadata.

5. **Train and Evaluate**:
   - Run the training script (`train_resnet_lstm.ipynb`) to train the model and generate evaluation plots.

## Dataset
This project uses the **Celeb-DF dataset**, which contains real and synthesized celebrity videos. Below is a sample of face frames extracted from the dataset:
